## Why Use Unity UI Storyboard?

When working on games or apps with intricate UI structures, the biggest challenges are:
- Defining a clear and consistent architecture.
- Establishing and maintaining design rules.
- Facilitating effective communication across multiple disciplines.

Unity UI Storyboard addresses these challenges by providing a **well-structured project template** to kickstart your UI development. It helps maintain order throughout the project lifecycle, allowing teams to focus on their core tasks without constantly revisiting basic structural decisions.

## Design Philosophy

Unity UI Storyboard is built to support collaborative workflows and structured development. Here's what it enables:

### Key Features:
- Designed with **practical Clean Code principles**, promoting readability and maintainability.
- Incorporates **Dependency Injection**, enabling flexible and decoupled component management.
- Supports **view-level testing**, ensuring that each UI element can be independently verified and debugged.
- Provides a structure that simplifies applying these principles, helping teams implement clean, testable, and scalable UI designs effortlessly.

### What You Can Do:
- **Planners** can conceptualize and annotate UI prototypes as storyboards.
- **Designers** can craft visual layouts based on these prototypes.
- **Programmers** can implement the necessary logic based on the structured views.
- All team members can easily **review, verify, and refine** the UI design together.

### What It Doesn't Do:
- It does not automatically generate working UI elements by simply connecting nodes or creating layouts without code. Coding and implementation are still essential parts of the process.
